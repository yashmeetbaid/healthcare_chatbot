# **Healthcare Chatbot**

## 🌟 **Description**
The Healthcare Chatbot is an intelligent desktop-based application designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions based on their symptoms. It leverages machine learning models and OpenAI's GPT for providing insightful responses and suggestions. The project uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface and various Python libraries for data handling and processing.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- API key for OpenAI (store securely as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### 🚀 **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wani-Chetan-999/Healthcare_Chatbot.git
   cd Healthcare_Chatbot
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```cmd
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
